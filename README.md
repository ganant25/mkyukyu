# Front-end-

Shevalues website front end design work

This is a react based project.
It needs to be cloned and then npm install and npm start commands are to be used to run this on your local system.

The project is appropriately commented and contains three major dashboards, Jobseeker signup, Registration form and the psychometric quiz login.
It also consists of the original homepage, but thats just a prototype and partner logos will have to be added to it.
Lastly, it contains a job seeker login, which isn't required for now.
